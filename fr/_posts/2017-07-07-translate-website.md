title: Help us with translation of this website
notranslate: 1

We're looking forward to expanding our website to another languages (French, German, French, Arabic, Chinese, ...).

Translating our website into another language was never easier. You just need a good text editor (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) that supports UTF-8 encoded files. Just create a new .yml file (named using ISO 639-1 code) based on **en.yml** in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/crystalidea/_i18n). You can also optionally translate .md files of blog posts. After that simply create a pull request so we can review it.

Every translator gets life-time license for all apps, priority customer support, access to beta/alpha versions of the software and optional backlink to your website.
