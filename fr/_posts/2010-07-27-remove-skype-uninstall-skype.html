<a href="http://www.skype.com/" target="blank">Skype</a> is a very popular program to chat and make voice calls over the Internet. Removing Skype from your PC can be a pain because it can leave lots of <strong>confidential information</strong>: contacts, recorded chats, sent SMS and others. Moreover it stores all the mentioned data in a insecure, non-encrypted way and it makes possible to read that information by everyone.</p>
