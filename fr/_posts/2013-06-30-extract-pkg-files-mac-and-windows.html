<p>PKG files are Mac OS X installation (setup) packages that contain installer scripts ('Scripts' file) and compressed installation files ('Payload' file) that are used to install Mac software applications onto a user's hard drive. With <a href="/anytoiso?ref=pkgextract">AnyToISO</a> it's possible to extract PKG file contents and even convert it to ISO format, on both Windows and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>The following files have also the same format and are supported by AnyToISO: .mpkg, .pfpkg</p>
