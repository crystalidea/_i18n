We don’t collect any financial information here (all purchase details go through our processors, which always use TLS/SSL encryption). But many people like the security of knowing that their interactions with a given site are encrypted. And now, they can be when you visit crystalidea.com.

We now also use HTTP2 protocol for modern browsers which boosts overall site performance.
