<p>Everyone who replaces HDD in most of iMac models faces the problem that HDD fan will start to spin at maximum speed after the replacement. This speed is about 6000-7000 RPM and the noise produced is unbearable (it happens because Apple puts special firmware in its HDDs)! What is more - you cannot just switch off the fan or put it rotating at MIN value (actually it's OK but only for SSD), because it will cause HDD overheating.</p>

<p class="font-xs"><strong>Note:</strong> (screenshots are provided for Mac but remember that Macs Fan Control also works flawlessly in Boot Camp Windows XP/Vista/7/8!)</p>

<p>If you replaced your HDD with some <b>SDD</b> - just set fan rotating at minimum speed (normally about 1000 RPM):</p>

<p>If you replaced your HDD with another <b>HDD</b> - you have to set it rotating in relation to HDD temperature:</p>

<p>These values (43C & 54C) are provided as an example for one of Seagate HDDs. One should referer to technical manual of his HDD and his preferences for noise/perfomance ballance.</p>
