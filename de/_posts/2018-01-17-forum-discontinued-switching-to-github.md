title: Switching to GitHub for support
---

We have discontinued our [phpBB forum](https://forums.crystalidea.com/) and moved support tickets to the GitHub issue tracker. GitHub issues is nowadays the best way to deal with bugs, feature requests and technical support problems.

[Issue Tracker for Uninstall Tool](https://github.com/crystalidea/uninstall-tool/issues)  
[Issue Tracker for AnyToISO](https://github.com/crystalidea/anytoiso-public/issues)  
[Issue Tracker for Macs Fan Control](https://github.com/crystalidea/macs-fan-control/issues)

Additionally we'll be keeping release archive for every app at GitHub (example for [Macs Fan Control](https://github.com/crystalidea/macs-fan-control/releases)) along with [its translations](https://github.com/crystalidea/macs-fan-control/tree/master/languages). If you feel comfortable with git, you can simply create a pull request to update your translation.

Another obvious advantages are:

- GitHub is convenient, intuitive and straightforward
- The old forum didn't seem to be active
- Many people already have a GitHub account, making a new one is a piece of cake
- Less work for us to administrate the forum and deal with spam

The old forum will stay online without the possibility of registering new users.
