Good news for happy owners of Apple iMac Pro! Th–µ current version of [Macs Fan Control](/macs-fan-control/download) (1.4.10) supports the new iMac Pro and correctly controls its enormous dual-fan cooler (both fans are synchronized). The app displays all available temperature sensors along with new twin SSDs.

Unfortunately, the app currently doesn't work on Windows (Boot Camp). We found no way to access SMC under Windows on this machine at the moment. Maybe it's a bug, but most likely Apple just doesn't really care to support SMC access under Windows. [More info](https://github.com/crystalidea/macs-fan-control/issues/32)
