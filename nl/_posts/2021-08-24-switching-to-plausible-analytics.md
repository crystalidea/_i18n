We're happy to announce that we recently switched from Google Analytics to [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), lightweight, privacy-friendly and open-source website analytics tool.

<!--more-->

- The script size is less than 1KB which is almost 50 times less than Google Analytics
- No cookies which means no cross-site or cross-device tracking, fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR
- No personal data is collected and all stats are in aggregate only. No connection to the AdTech and surveillance capitalism
- Fully open source web analytics software that is self-hosted by us at [webstatistics.io](https://webstatistics.io/)

Big brother is **no longer** watching you.
