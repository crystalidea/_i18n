<p>
DMG is a native disk image format of Mac OS X and actually the only way to burn a DMG image on a CD/DVD disk was to have Mac OS X system and its Disk Utility program.
But with <a href="{{ "/anytoiso?source=page&campaign=burndmg" | relative_url }}">AnyToISO app</a> you can convert DMG to ISO and burn the resulting ISO image with any software you like.
