<p>One often needs to convert a RAR archive to ISO using direct conversion (no need to use one program to extract and the other to create ISO). A common use case of such conversion is possibility to mount resulting ISO images without having to unpack (mount to virtual machine or a virtual drive). Here comes <a href="{{ "/anytoiso?source=page&campaign=rartoiso" | relative_url }}">AnyToISO</a>, it does the job in a <u>single click</u>:</p>
